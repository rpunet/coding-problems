# **0058 - Length of Last Word**

(C)

Given a string s consists of upper/lower-case alphabets and empty space characters ' ', return the length of last word (last word means the last appearing word if we loop from left to right) in the string.

If the last word does not exist, return 0.

Note: A word is defined as a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.

```
Example:

Input: "Hello World"
Output: 5
```

# **0121 - Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock**

(C)

Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.

```
Example 1:

Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
             Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price.
Example 2:

Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```
# **0134 - Gas Station**

(C)

There are N gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at station i is gas[i].

You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs cost[i] of gas to travel from station i to its next station (i+1). You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.

Return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return -1.

**Note:**

If there exists a solution, it is guaranteed to be unique.
Both input arrays are non-empty and have the same length.
Each element in the input arrays is a non-negative integer.
```
Example 1:

Input: 
gas  = [1,2,3,4,5]
cost = [3,4,5,1,2]

Output: 3

Explanation:
Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 4. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6
Travel to station 2. Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5
Travel to station 3. The cost is 5. Your gas is just enough to travel back to station 3.
Therefore, return 3 as the starting index.
Example 2:

Input: 
gas  = [2,3,4]
cost = [3,4,3]

Output: -1

Explanation:
You can't start at station 0 or 1, as there is not enough gas to travel to the next station.
Let's start at station 2 and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 4 - 3 + 2 = 3
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 3 - 3 + 3 = 3
You cannot travel back to station 2, as it requires 4 unit of gas but you only have 3.
Therefore, you can't travel around the circuit once no matter where you start.
```
# **0152 - Maximum Product SubArray**

(C)

Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray within an array (containing at least one number) which has the largest product.

```
Example 1:

Input: [2,3,-2,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: [2,3] has the largest product 6.
Example 2:

Input: [-2,0,-1]
Output: 0
Explanation: The result cannot be 2, because [-2,-1] is not a subarray.
```
# **0165 - Compare Version Numbers**

(C)

*Compare two version numbers version1 and version2.*

If version1 > version2 return 1; if version1 < version2 return -1; otherwise return 0. You may assume that the version strings are non-empty and contain only digits and the . character. The '.' character does not represent a decimal point and is used to separate number sequences.
For instance, 2.5 is not "two and a half" or "half way to version three", it is the fifth second-level revision of the second first-level revision.
You may assume the default revision number for each level of a version number to be 0. For example, version number 3.4 has a revision number of 3 and 4 for its first and second level revision number. Its third and fourth level revision number are both 0.

```
Example 1:

Input: version1 = "0.1", version2 = "1.1"
Output: -1

Example 2:

Input: version1 = "1.0.1", version2 = "1"
Output: 1

Example 3:

Input: version1 = "7.5.2.4", version2 = "7.5.3"
Output: -1

Example 4:

Input: version1 = "1.01", version2 = "1.001"
Output: 0
Explanation: Ignoring leading zeroes, both “01” and “001" represent the same number “1”

Example 5:

Input: version1 = "1.0", version2 = "1.0.0"
Output: 0
Explanation: The first version number does not have a third level revision number, which means its third level revision number is default to "0" 
```

**Note:**

Version strings are composed of numeric strings separated by dots . and this numeric strings may have leading zeroes.

Version strings do not start or end with dots, and they will not be two consecutive dots.

# **0179 - Largest Number**

(C)

Given a list of non negative integers, arrange them such that they form the largest number.
```
Example 1:

Input: [10,2]
Output: "210"

Example 2:

Input: [3,30,34,5,9]
Output: "9534330"
```
**Note:** The result may be very large, so you need to return a string instead of an integer.

# **0198 - House Robbers**

(C)

You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security system connected and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.

Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

 ```
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
             Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,7,9,3,1]
Output: 12
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) and rob house 5 (money = 1).
             Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.
 
```
**Constraints:**
```
0 <= nums.length <= 100
0 <= nums[i] <= 400
```
# **0229 - Majority Element II**

(C)

Given an integer array of size n, find all elements that appear more than ⌊ n/3 ⌋ times.

Note: The algorithm should run in linear time and in O(1) space.
```
Example 1:

Input: [3,2,3]
Output: [3]
Example 2:

Input: [1,1,1,3,3,2,2,2]
Output: [1,2]
```

# **0299 - Bulls and Cows**

(C)

You are playing the following Bulls and Cows game with your friend: You write down a number and ask your friend to guess what the number is. Each time your friend makes a guess, you provide a hint that indicates how many digits in said guess match your secret number exactly in both digit and position (called "bulls") and how many digits match the secret number but locate in the wrong position (called "cows"). Your friend will use successive guesses and hints to eventually derive the secret number.

Write a function to return a hint according to the secret number and friend's guess, use A to indicate the bulls and B to indicate the cows. 

Please note that both secret number and friend's guess may contain duplicate digits.

```
Example 1:

Input: secret = "1807", guess = "7810"

Output: "1A3B"

Explanation: 1 bull and 3 cows. The bull is 8, the cows are 0, 1 and 7.
Example 2:

Input: secret = "1123", guess = "0111"

Output: "1A1B"

Explanation: The 1st 1 in friend's guess is a bull, the 2nd or 3rd 1 is a cow.
```
**Note:**

You may assume that the secret number and your friend's guess only contain digits, and their lengths are always equal.

# **0389 - Find the Difference**

(C)

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Find the letter that was added in t.
```
Example:

Input:
s = "abcd"
t = "abcde"

Output:
e

Explanation:
'e' is the letter that was added.
```

```
Example:

Input: [3, 10, 5, 25, 2, 8]

Output: 28

Explanation: The maximum result is 5 ^ 25 = 28.
```

# **0459 - Repeated Substring Pattern**

(C)

Given a non-empty string check if it can be constructed by taking a substring of it and appending multiple copies of the substring together. You may assume the given string consists of lowercase English letters only and its length will not exceed 10000.
```
Example 1:

Input: "abab"
Output: True
Explanation: It's the substring "ab" twice.
Example 2:

Input: "aba"
Output: False
Example 3:

Input: "abcabcabcabc"
Output: True
Explanation: It's the substring "abc" four times. (And the substring "abcabc" twice.)
```

# **0949 - Largest Time for Given Digits**
 
 (C)

Given an array arr of 4 digits, find the latest 24-hour time that can be made using each digit exactly once.

24-hour times are formatted as "HH:MM", where HH is between 00 and 23, and MM is between 00 and 59. The earliest 24-hour time is 00:00, and the latest is 23:59.

Return the latest 24-hour time in "HH:MM" format.  If no valid time can be made, return an empty string.

```
Example 1:

Input: A = [1,2,3,4]
Output: "23:41"
Explanation: The valid 24-hour times are "12:34", "12:43", "13:24", "13:42", "14:23", "14:32", "21:34", "21:43", "23:14", and "23:41". Of these times, "23:41" is the latest.
Example 2:

Input: A = [5,5,5,5]
Output: ""
Explanation: There are no valid 24-hour times as "55:55" is not valid.
Example 3:

Input: A = [0,0,0,0]
Output: "00:00"
Example 4:

Input: A = [0,0,1,0]

# **1041 - Robot Bounded In Circle**
 
 (C)
 
 On an infinite plane, a robot initially stands at (0, 0) and faces north.  The robot can receive one of three instructions:

"G": go straight 1 unit;
"L": turn 90 degrees to the left;
"R": turn 90 degress to the right.
The robot performs the instructions given in order, and repeats them forever.

Return true if and only if there exists a circle in the plane such that the robot never leaves the circle.
```
Example 1:

Input: "GGLLGG"
Output: true
Explanation: 
The robot moves from (0,0) to (0,2), turns 180 degrees, and then returns to (0,0).
When repeating these instructions, the robot remains in the circle of radius 2 centered at the origin.
Example 2:

Input: "GG"
Output: false
Explanation: 
The robot moves north indefinitely.
Example 3:

Input: "GL"
Output: true
Explanation: 
The robot moves from (0, 0) -> (0, 1) -> (-1, 1) -> (-1, 0) -> (0, 0) -> ...
```
